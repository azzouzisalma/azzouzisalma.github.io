      <description>This project aims to develop a shared and distributed memory system on networked machines. It is divided into two phases, the first of which aims to develop a program launcher, which has the task of launching different processes on remote machines via SSH, while retrieving and centralizing the standard and error outputs of these machines. This first program also sets up everything necessary for the DSM in the next step, such as setting up listening sockets leading to an interconnection of all processes between them.</description>
