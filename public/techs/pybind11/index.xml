      <description>The main issue in communications is ensuring a reliable transfer of data. In order to do so, many channels and system models have been implemented with tractable mathematical models. In this regard, AFF3CT is a library that is used to implement the physical layer of most current and future standards (WiFi, 4G, 5G &amp;hellip;). Todayâ€™s communication systems have been thoroughly optimized making them very efficient and stable. Introducing deep learning into such systems may not be as efficient in communications as it is in other fields such as speech recognition and computer vision.</description>
