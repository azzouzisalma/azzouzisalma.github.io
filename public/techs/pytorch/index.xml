      <description>The main issue in communications is ensuring a reliable transfer of data. In order to do so, many channels and system models have been implemented with tractable mathematical models. In this regard, AFF3CT is a library that is used to implement the physical layer of most current and future standards (WiFi, 4G, 5G &amp;hellip;). Todayâ€™s communication systems have been thoroughly optimized making them very efficient and stable. Introducing deep learning into such systems may not be as efficient in communications as it is in other fields such as speech recognition and computer vision.</description>

      <description>I am a laureate of the engineer-doctor course of my school. This experience introduced me to the field of research through the exercise of thematic bibliographic study of papers. My tutor Mr. Romain Tajan and I were working on the approach of exploiting deep learning to handle wireless OFDM channels in an end-to-end manner.
The simulation results show that the deep learning method has advantages when wireless channels are complicated by serious distortion and interference, which proves that DNNs have the ability to remember and analyze complicated characteristics of wirless channel.</description>
