 A higher number of dimensions theoretically allows for more information to be stored, but in practice it is rarely useful  because of the increased possibility of noise and redundancy in real-world data.
Thus, several methods have been developed to perform dimension reduction. In this work, I  present two linear dimension reduction methods, namely: Principal component analysis, and linear discriminant analysis.
