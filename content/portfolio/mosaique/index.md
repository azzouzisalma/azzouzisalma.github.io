An image mosaic is the combination of several images having a part in common in order to reconstruct a panoramic and unified view so that objects representing the same structures are superimposed.
These images can be observed from different angles.
The construction of a mosaic requires first the conversion of the images into triples (I,M,B).

The second step is the estimation of the geometrical transformation between the spaces of the different images **Homography**.
Finally, the transformed image and the destination image are merged to form our mosaic.
