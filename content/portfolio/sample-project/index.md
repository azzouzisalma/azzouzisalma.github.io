The main goals of the project were visualizing electrocardiogram (ECG: test that detects and records the strength
and timing of cardiac electrical activity) to analyze the spectrium and then using Pan and Tompkins algorithm to detect the QRS complexes that allow us to detect cardiac pathologies. See  [**Github link**](https://github.com/azzouzisalma/MICA-Project) above for more details about the code and the report.
