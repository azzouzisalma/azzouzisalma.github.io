I am a laureate of the engineer-doctor course of my school. This experience introduced me to the field of research through the exercise of thematic bibliographic study of papers. My tutor Mr. [Romain Tajan](https://rtajan.github.io/) and I were working on the approach of exploiting deep learning to handle wireless OFDM channels in an end-to-end manner. 
 
The simulation results show that the
deep learning method has advantages when wireless channels
are complicated by serious distortion and interference, which
proves that DNNs have the ability to remember and analyze complicated characteristics of wirless channel. For more details, please check my **Github repository above**.
