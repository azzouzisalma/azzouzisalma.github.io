Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) is implemented in air traffic systems as a complement to conventional radar.
It allows the aircraft to estimate their positions thanks to GPS technology.
These signals are then picked up by the antennas.
The objective of this project is to process these signals in order to decode and display their content and to simulate in real time the ADS-B transmitter/receiver.
