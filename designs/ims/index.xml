This experience introduced me to the field of research through the exercise of thematic bibliographic study of papers. My tutor Mr. Romain Tajan and I were working on the approach of exploiting deep learning to handle wireless OFDM channels in an end-to-end manner.
The simulation results show that the deep learning method has advantages when wireless channels are complicated by serious distortion and interference, which proves that DNNs have the ability to remember and analyze complicated characteristics of wirless channel.</description></item></channel></rss>
